			"A fellowship is a communion of people sharing a common interest. The Elliott Erwitt Havana Club 7 fellows aim to leave an undying legacy to the world and to be able to witness its past by documenting the essence of an untouched land, a country that stands still in the late 1950’s Revolution.",
			"The Fellowship will have a legacy like none other, led by a man whose work has inspired and guided the most prestigious documentary photography agency, Magnum. With a storied style, Erwitt goes back to the island that gave him one of his most storied assignments.",
			"He will then head a committee of photography’s greatest minds to choose today’s greatest talents and let them explore the human condition in Cuba through documentary photography and give us their own vision."
