He has photographed Khrushchev and Nixon arguing in Moscow, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in Havana and President JFK in the Oval office.","Born in Paris in 1928 to Russian parents, Erwitt moved to the US with his family in 1939 and it was there that he met Edward Steichen and Roy Stryker. Recruited to Magnum Photos by Robert Capa in 1953 Erwitt has been a member of the prestigious agency ever since and has served several terms as its president. ","To date Erwitt has produced more than 25 photography books including Eastern Europe (1965), The Private Experience (1974), Personal Exposures (1988), To the Dogs (1992), and Personal Best (2010).
